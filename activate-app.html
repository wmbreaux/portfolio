            <h1>The Activate App</h1>
            <img src="./public/images/activate-1.png" alt="activate-1">
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>I had the opportunity to be lead designer for Bridg's Activate App—a new quick service restaurant
                (QSR) app to be sold to clients like Texas Roadhouse, Firehouse Subs, and Church's Chicken.</p>
            <p>From inception to execution, I translated a complex business idea into a fully functional product that
                lowered costs, improved efficiency, and earned the company new clients.</p>
            <p>The Activate App is featured on <a href="https://bridg.com/products/mobile-loyalty/">Bridg's website</a>
                and is currently being sold to new and existing clients!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-2">
            <h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Maintained product vision and met deadlines</li>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> Conducted user research and competitive analysis, allowing me to create a
                    user-centered product</li>
                <li><strong>UX Design:</strong> Managed a junior UX designer, creating over 50 high-fidelity mock-ups
                    and an interactive prototype</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Collaborated with Bridg’s cross-functional teams for feedback to
                    iterate the product</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Bridg's 20+ clients have highly custom apps, so managing each can be a
                    resource-exhausted process, particularly when technical issues arise.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem 2:</strong> Bridg endeavored a new market of smaller potential clients who want
                    mobile apps, but cannot afford the costs to develop such custom apps.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section-3">
            <h1>The Process</h1>
            <img src="./public/images/activate-2.jpg" alt="activate-2">
            <h2 id="main">DEFINE</h2>
            <p>I first met with company stakeholders to understand the goals and objectives for the project.</p>
            <h2>ANALYZE</h2>
            <p><strong>Internal Audit:</strong> I started the process internally, reviewing hundreds of Bridg's customer
                support tickets found in their admin panel, noting common user pain points and any feature
                requests. I also utilized App Bot, an AI-powered customer experience analysis tool, to analyze
                each of Bridg's clients to create an Internal Audit document, which included all-time app reviews
                and ratings, feature requests, and the top positive and negative user sentiments. This
                information would help me make the most informed decisions when designing the user interface. </p>
            <p><strong>External Audit:</strong> Once I understood Bridg's internal strengths and weaknesses, I
                downloaded the
                mobile apps of Bridg's competitors, analyzing their app reviews, feature offerings, interface
                designs, and overall user experiences. Because I had not previously used QSR apps to order food
                ahead with my smartphone, I also ordered lunch from a new app every day, noting what I liked and
                disliked about the overall user experience—from the sign-up process to picking up my food at the
                restaurant.</p>
            <h3>My Findings</h3>
            <p>Users were motivated to use QSR apps to save time, so they order ahead with the expectation that
                their food would be ready when once they arrive at the restaurant. The top frustrations among
                users were app-related technical issues such as orders not processing or app crashes and orders
                not being ready when they arrived at the restaurant.</p>
            <h2>IDEATE</h2>
            <p>Bridg’s junior UX designer and I created over 50 high-fidelity mock-ups and presented them to the
                product team each week for feedback and iteration (see screen shots below).</p>

                    <h1>Home Screen</h1>
                    <p>To incentivize users to sign up for the program, I designed the home screen with the Rewards
                        module displaying a large, enticing image of the free reward as the first thing the user sees
                        when opening the app!</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>Messages</h1>
                    <p>Messages is an effective way for brands to communicate with users regarding special promotions,
                        limited time offers, and free rewards. I designed this screen to be easily accessed from the
                        Home Screen, ensuring that the brand's messages are seen by its users.</p>

                    <h1>Rewards</h1>
                    <p>Brands are incentived to offer a rewards program because they are tied to sales, and studies
                        have shown that loyal users spend more than non-loyal users.</p>
                    <p>When designing the Rewards screen, I placed reward points at the top of the screen and used
                        large, appetizing images of reward items to entice users to spend more to redeem rewards.</p>
