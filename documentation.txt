There are four media queries based on viewport size: Desktop/laptop, large tablet, small tablet, and mobile 
devices. On any viewport smaller than 730 pixels (small tablet and below), the navigation bar will collapse into a 
button that creates a dropdown menu. Most of the images on the site are sized based on the viewport width 
(vw units) so that they scale based on device size. 

There are also several uses of flexbox such as the landing page where, on desktop size (1224 pixels and up), multiple images are displayed in a row (flex-direction: row), but on smaller devices will be moved into a column (flex-direction: column) and made larger to fit the screen so that they are more easily viewable. The middle section of the Activate App page, below the "Ideate" header, uses a CSS 
grid to align the images and text alongside each other. On smaller devices, this grid is changed into a column of 
images with their corresponding text below them, to make everything easier to see.

The axe validator runs successfully, the only elements that have warnings are iframe elements (the embedded
Youtube videos), which have captions built-in, and the landing page text that covers the images, which is black on 
white text. The content within iframe elements can't be changed because they are being imported by Youtube.
