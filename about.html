                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>My marketing background, passion for design, and experience as CEO of a start-up
                    provides me a unique perspective on connecting people with brands though meaningful
                    user experiences. Recently, I was the lead designer on a mobile project for Bridg
                    that is currently being sold to clients like Texas Roadhouse, Firehouse Subs, and
                    Church's Chicken.</p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a <strong>Master of Science in Information (UX Concentration)</strong>
                    from the University of Michigan to refine my user-centered design approach. Feel free to
                    contact me at <strong>wesleymbreaux@gmail.com</strong> as I am currently seeking a summer
                    internship.

                <h2>My long-time fascination with <em>design</em></h2>
                <p>Whether I was developing a sprawling metropolis on Sim City or creating a world-class theme park,
                    I spent my free time creating the biggest, boldest designs my adolescent mind could imagine
                    (shown here).</p>

            <h2>Target Markets, Branding, and Logos: My <em>Passion</em> for Marketing</h2>
            <p>As a I grew older, I became interested in how companies used branding to connect with their target
                audience, leading me to earn a Bachelor of Science in Marketing from University of New Orleans. After
                graduation, I pursued my entrepreneurial venture where I created two of my own brands, Fire and
                Razzou, to launch one of the first dating apps!</p>

            <h2>CEO at 23-Years-Old: My Cross-Country Journey to Launch <em>Razzou</em>.</h2>
            <p>Leaving my tiny hometown in Louisiana with little money but a solid business plan, I began raising
                capital to develop and launch my app. On my own, I raised $200,000 in capital to finance the launch
                of my dating app, named Razzou, which earned over 100,000 users worldwide.</p>
            <h2 class="reg-font">Managing a Start-up</h2>
            <p>As CEO of an early-stage, start-up company, I confronted a new set of seemingly insurmountable
                obstacles every day. My responsibilities included resolving tech issues as quickly and efficiently
                as possible, while remaining flexible and adaptable enough to overcome any unforeseen difficulties.
                When the app’s server failed, for example, thousands of profile photos were lost, and I had to figure
                out how to get them back—then make sure it couldn’t happen again.</p>
            <p>I also managed the business, overseeing numerous concurrent development projects and budgets. I
                conducted frequent analyses of leading competitors, studying their app interfaces, target markets,
                business models, and pricing, all while keeping up with innovations in the smartphone market to
                maintain a competitive edge. My job also required continuous reporting to company investors and the
                nurturing of key business relationships.</p>

            <p class="small-bold">TODAY</p>
            <h2>Discovering My UX Design Skills</h2>
            <p>Undoubtedly my favorite task as CEO was ensuring that Razzou offered its 100,000 users an exciting
                mobile dating experience. Over time, other dating apps flooded the market with million-dollar
                marketing budgets and Razzou could not financially compete. So after spending over six years on
                the project, I decided to take the invaluable skills learned from this experience and turn my
                passion for UX Design and Product Management into an exciting career.</p>
